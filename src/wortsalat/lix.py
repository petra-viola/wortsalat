    """
    Calculate the LIX readability index for the given text.

    The LIX index is a measure of text readability, calculated as the sum of the average sentence length
    (number of words per sentence) and the percentage of long words (words with more than six letters).
    This readability measure was developed by Swedish scholar Carl-Hugo BjÃ¶rnsson.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The input text for which the LIX index will be calculated.

    Returns:
    - float: The LIX readability index for the input text.
